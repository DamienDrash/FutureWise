# Product Mission

## Pitch

FutureWise is a multi-tenant SaaS for e-commerce scenario management that helps e-commerce managers and analysts forecast outcomes and make confident decisions by providing fast data import, ML-based simulations, and visual planning tools.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- E-commerce Managers: Own commercial performance (revenue, margin, conversion) and need reliable forecasts for promotions, pricing, and inventory.
- Business Analysts: Build models, evaluate scenarios, and present insights to stakeholders under time constraints.

### User Personas

**E-commerce Manager** (28-45 years old)
- **Role:** Commercial owner of online store KPIs
- **Context:** Coordinates pricing, promotions, and inventory with marketing and operations
- **Pain Points:** Uncertain forecasts for promotions; siloed data; slow iteration cycles
- **Goals:** Improve forecast accuracy; accelerate planning; maximize margin with controlled risk

**Business Analyst** (25-40 years old)
- **Role:** Translates data into decisions for commercial teams
- **Context:** Under pressure to deliver analyses quickly; deals with disparate data sources and ad-hoc scenarios
- **Pain Points:** Manual data joins; brittle spreadsheets; limited reproducibility and auditability
- **Goals:** Faster scenario iteration; transparent assumptions; reproducible results

## The Problem

### Slow, manual forecasting workflows
Manual spreadsheets and ad-hoc scripts delay decision cycles by days to weeks. Teams miss opportunity windows and waste 20-40% of analysis time on data prep.

**Our Solution:** One-click data import and scenario templates reduce setup from days to hours while enforcing consistent assumptions.

### Inaccurate promotion and inventory planning
Under/over-forecasting results in stockouts or excess inventory, impacting 2-5% of GMV and 1-3pp margin.

**Our Solution:** ML-based simulations with adjustable indicators improve forecast accuracy and quantify uncertainty bands.

### Poor reproducibility and governance
Decisions get made from fragile spreadsheets with unclear versions and assumptions, creating audit risk and rework.

**Our Solution:** Versioned scenarios, audit trails, and role-based access control ensure traceability and compliance.

## Differentiators

### End-to-end scenario lifecycle in one workspace
Unlike spreadsheet-driven approaches, we combine data import, modeling, simulation, and visualization in a governed flow. This shortens time-to-decision by 50-80% in pilot studies.

### Multi-tenant architecture for rapid rollout
Unlike bespoke BI projects, FutureWise is multi-tenant and can onboard new tenants within hours via standardized connectors and templates.

### Adjustable indicator engine with visual forecasting
Competitors often provide static models. We expose key indicators (price elasticity, promo uplift, seasonality, traffic) with interactive controls and live forecast previews for transparent what-if analysis.

## Key Features

### Core Features

- **Historical KPI Data Import (API, CSV, XLS, Webhook):** Consolidate sales, traffic, inventory, and marketing KPIs from multiple sources in hours, not weeks.
- **ML-based Scenario Simulation:** Forecast demand, revenue, margin, and inventory impact with uncertainty bands and backtesting.
- **Preset Scenario Templates:** Start fast with templates (e.g., price change, promo uplift, traffic shock, seasonality shifts).
- **Custom Scenario Creation:** Compose multi-factor scenarios with adjustable indicators and time windows.
- **Adjustable Indicators:** Tune elasticity, promo uplift, seasonality, CAC/traffic drivers, and inventory constraints.
- **Visual Forecasting UI:** Compare scenarios vs. baseline with charts, KPIs, and confidence intervals.
- **Scenario Storage & Versioning:** Save, clone, tag, and track changes with full audit trails.

### Collaboration Features

- **Multi-tenant & RBAC:** Isolate data by tenant; manage roles (viewer, analyst, manager) securely.
- **Sharing & Approvals:** Share scenarios for review, comment, and approval with decision logs.
- **API & Webhooks:** Automate scenario creation and publish results to downstream systems.
